# FABLE JOB QUEUE — work that requires the flagship seat, held until quota allows

**Why this file exists.** Fable usage ran high on 2026-08-16 and the owner asked to conserve it.
Two standing directives make some work *only* Fable's, so it cannot simply be reassigned:

- **`regress` is FABLE-ONLY** — only the flagship seat reviews regression, batched.
- **full panel on every stage** — a stage is not complete without all nine seats, and Fable is
  one of them. Under the stop-and-ask rule, a stage missing Fable is **held**, not degraded.

**The rule this file enforces on itself:** a queued job is not a done job. Nothing here may be
counted as reviewed, and no round may close on the strength of a queued entry. If a round needs a
Fable stage and Fable is unavailable, the round **waits** — that is the directive, and the whole
reason the queue is written down rather than remembered.

## QUEUED — in priority order

### 1. `gate3scope` (#436) — review stage, pass 2 on the diff
**Status: BLOCKING the round's closure.** Eight of nine seats have answered the *research* stage
and the implementation is done and gated, but the **review stage has not run at all**. Under the
full-panel rule this round cannot close until all nine review it, Fable included.

What Fable specifically should attack, given what the other seats already found:
- The control is a **liveness sentinel**, not a census — a measure seat proved 23 of 24 rows can
  be inert with both gate 2 and the self-mutant green. Is the shipped *wording* honest about that,
  or does it still read as a coverage claim anywhere?
- The **manifest** is the piece meant to stop this recurring on differential #12. Is a dated
  exemption list of six the right shape, or does a named exemption become permanent furniture?
- `selfmutant.py` scores a build failure as `SETUP`, deliberately unlike gate 3's `build_and_run()`
  which counts a crash as a detection (filed `#55`). Is the new helper's contract airtight, or does
  it have its own version of that bug?

### 2. Regression review of the next full battery
**FABLE-ONLY by directive.** The last one (R1–R9, three green batteries) is complete and committed.
The next battery — scheduled **23 Aug 18:00**, or any manual run before it — needs its own Fable
adjudication. It should specifically re-examine whether #436 changed what a green battery licenses:
the honest answer is probably *"a little, in one narrow way"*, and that is worth saying precisely.

### 3. `selfmutant6` — assess stage, when the round is taken
Six differentials still have no failability control (`ieee_store` genuinely covered by gate 3; the
other five are real debt). When that round starts it needs a full nine-seat assess stage.

### 4. `m8online` (`9494c6a`) — regression review never done, found mechanically
**FABLE-ONLY, and this entry is the first thing `check_fable_queue.py` caught.** The row is closed,
it changed code, and it has no `regress` entry. I first assumed the batched R1–R9 pass had covered
it and was about to write the attribution in — then read the brief's scope table, which lists R7 as
`#433`, a *different* commit. `9494c6a` appears nowhere in it. **So this is a real gap, and the
comfortable reading of it would have produced a rubber stamp on an unreviewed commit.**

Nearby and worth contrasting: `b47`/`b27` looked identical to this case and were **not** queued,
because their commit `2458cfb` *is* R5 and the brief does name it. They only ever lacked the
attribution, which is now written in. Two rows that look the same to the gate, two different
honest answers — which is why the gate names rows and does not decide them.

### 5. `exitsweep` — all three stages, PRE-EMPTIVELY QUEUED before the round starts
The next round by the owner's choice: `dev_luna88k.c:815` calls `exit(1)` on a guest write to
`INT_ST_MASK0-3` with any of bits 25..0 set (verified live). Under the full-panel rule its
**assess, research and review** stages each need all nine seats.

This is queued *before* the round exists on purpose. Every silent Fable gap in the ledger was
created mid-round, at the moment the stage was ready and the seat was not — which is exactly when
the queue is least likely to get written. Naming the three stages now means the round starts with
the obligation already recorded rather than discovering it at the point of maximum temptation
to proceed with eight.

## HOW TO RUN ONE

Agent tool, `model: "fable"`, framed as the SEAT role rather than the main-loop adjudicator — the
two hats are distinct and the seat reviews the design on its merits. Brief goes in
`_scratchpad/`, and the answer must be **read and recorded in `pipeline/ledger.json`**, or
`pipeline/check_seats_read.py` will fail the next commit. That check exists because three panels'
worth of seat answers went unread on this project, twice caught by the owner's eye rather than by
the harness.

## DEQUEUE DISCIPLINE

Delete an entry only when its answer is **recorded in the ledger** — not when the job is launched,
and not when it is skimmed. `check_stage_panels.py` is the mechanical backstop: it fails any
post-cutoff stage that moved on without all nine seats, so a silently dropped Fable job reddens
the next commit rather than passing quietly.

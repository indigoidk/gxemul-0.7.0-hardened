"""pcc2defaultkill DETECTOR (#501) -- the `default:' arm of DEVICE_ACCESS(pcc2) in dev_pcc2.c.

Before #501 that arm ended the emulator process (`exit(1)') on ANY access to an offset with no `case'
-- READS included, although the memcpy above the switch had already served them.  Forty-three of the
0x40 byte offsets reach it (derived from mvme_pcctworeg.h against the case list): eighteen NAMED
registers the model does not implement (PSCALECNT, GPIO_ICR/PCR, SCCMOIACK, SCCTXIACK, IEERR, IEICR,
IEBERR, SCSIERR, the printer block, SPEED, PRTDATA), the bytes INSIDE the four 32-bit counter/compare
words, and the unnamed offsets.  A single guest `st.b' or `ld.bu' at any of them was a host kill
(rung-3 witness, 7/13 on the committed build: regress/artifacts/pcc2defaultkill/witness_20260905/).

THE FIX (pass-1 panel of 2026-09-05, nine seats, converged): READ side -- keep the byte the memcpy
already served (it is the register array's default, NOT a computed value: the announce says so);
WRITE side -- DECLINE + a per-offset latched `fatal()' ("(once)", the house idiom), NOT a backed
accept: the file's own cased siblings contradict a blanket store (SCCERR is write-to-clear, the ICRs
mask and reassert, PSCALECNT/SPEED/the IACKs are read-only), the addition licence is unmet (no guest
reaches these offsets on this model -- if_ie never attaches), and a store into pcctwo_reg[] from the
one arm reached by 43 offsets adds a bounded-write surface the decline does not have.

CONTRACT -- what this detector is built to catch, by row:
  (b) the verbatim `exit(1)' reinstated             -> every survival row (named wr/rd, inword, unnamed, alias)
  (d) the announce unlatched                        -> `latch sameoff' (2 lines, not 1)
  (d) one whole-arm latch bit instead of per-offset -> `latch twooff' (1 line, not 2), `named wr msg' (1, not 18)
  (d) a writeflag guard that re-kills READS         -> `named rd' (host exit)
  (d) the direction test inverted in the text       -> `dir wr text' / `dir rd text'
  member 6 (BACKED ACCEPT) substituted for member 3 -> `ieicr rdawr' / `ieerr rdawr' read back the stored
      byte (0x5a) instead of 0x0 -- the DISPOSITION-pinning rows; `sccerr rdawr' (a CASED, write-to-clear
      sibling) is the control that reads 0x0 under either and makes the delta attributable
  the `relative_addr %= PCC2_SIZE' fold changed      -> `alias msg' (the announce names offset 0x2a, not 0x6a)
  the fix perturbing a cased arm                    -> `genctl rt', `t1cmp word rt'
DISCLOSED, not caught: the in-word bytes are the interior of IMPLEMENTED counters, declined here as a
width/alignment matter (pcc2widecompose's business), not as unimplemented registers; the fold of
0x40..0xfff onto 0x00..0x3f IS the real part's: Motorola VMESBCP2 Table 6-1 lists $FFF42040-$FFF42FFF as
'PCCchip2 Registers  Repeated' (_scratchpad/vmesbcp2.txt:4629, fetched at the codex seat's citation -- two
seats had rightly called it unestablished before the manual was on disk), so `alias 0x6a' pins a documented
behaviour; the fork's PCC2_SIZE (0x40) and the guest header's (0x1000) name different things;
the IACK offsets 0x23/0x25 are declined like the rest -- modelling them (on the SCCRXIACK shape) would
open two new entries into the C040 path, so pcc2c040kill goes first; `named wr'/`named rd' touch all
eighteen offsets in ONE session each (valid because the fix has no per-offset branch; `named wr msg'
localises a failure) -- if a later round branches per offset this compression is invalid.
The debugger's `put b' never reaches a DM_DEFAULT arm (measured): `put b ctl' is a control, not a witness.

Usage: python3 pcc2_default_probe.py <gxemul> <label>      Sentinel: PCC2D_PROBE_DONE
The pty session helper is the width probe's own (extracted at run time), never hand-rolled: a first
draft of the witness hand-rolled it and read every host kill as "survived".
